# omdbapi-frontend

A basic interface for accessing the API provided by http://www.omdbapi.com and
displaying related information.

This is primarily a toy project. It's also my first Clojure project outside of
toying around in a REPL; be gentle.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

Using standard processes it should be possible to install the other
dependencies using leiningen via `lein deps`.

You will also need npm, the node package manager, if you'd like to change any
jsx code; precompiled versions are provided for convenience.  Install
dependencies with `npm install` and build javascript with `npm run js`.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

## Known Imperfections

 * Compiled JS is checked into the repository. Probably better otherwise, but
   this seems a lot nicer for running quickly for Clojure users.
 * Build tools: this uses npm as a build tool as recommended by
   http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/, but something
   like Gulp or Grunt might be more practical.
