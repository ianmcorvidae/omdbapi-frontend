# omdbapi-frontend

A basic interface for accessing the API provided by http://www.omdbapi.com and displaying related information.

This is primarily a toy project. It's also my first Clojure project outside of toying around in a REPL; be gentle.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

Using standard processes it should be possible to install the other
dependencies using leiningen.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server
